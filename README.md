# City Quest Web

City Quest Web is an educational exploration game of Guelph's rich historical past. This is a web version of the game. A version is being developed in C#/Unity, as well as React Native, by me, just for fun. It is currently under development.

This app best runs on your mobile device. You'll need to allow the app permission to use your camera, your GPS, and to access your filesystem to cache your clues.
